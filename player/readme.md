# Player Input

Store different player configurations here.  The data in each input file is stored using comma separated values (csv); each line must have *two* commas in order for the file to be processed without errors.  Otherwise, do not delete or re-order any lines of the input file.

#### Notes:
- Any non-blank character will suffice for the (activated/equipped) options to register.
- Only one pet can be activated at a time; if multiple are activated then only the top-most activated pet is considered.
- Any amount of equipment may be active at once.
